# Bramboráky

- 10 large potatoes, wash and peel
- Rasp 5 of these coarse, 5 of them finer
- Add two eggs
- Add two handfuls of flower
- A little bit of milk
- 3-5 cloves of garlic
- Add cumin, salt, and marjoram

Fry on a pan with butter/margarine, not on oil, and turn once the sides a browning.
I typically apply the butter/margerine from the "outside" and let it melt
from the sides under the bramborák.

Enjoy hot, either with salt or with jam.
