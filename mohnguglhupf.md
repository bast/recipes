# Mohngugelhupf

After Johanna Maier's recipe.


### Prepare/buy

- 200 g butter
- 8 eggs 
- 180 g sugar
- 60 g powder sugar
- 300 g poppyseed (ground; but I buy them whole and use a coffee grinder)
- 150 g almond flour
- Cinnamon
- Vanilla sugar

---

### 1 hour before you start

- Take eggs out of the fridge

---

### Possible modifications

- Instead of almond flour can also be ground hazelnut
- It does not have to be exactly 300 g and 150 g, only important that it adds to 450 g
- Possible to add other spices

---

### Then

- Turn on oven to 170 deg C
- Butter the gugelhupf form
- Separate eggs into white (bowl A) and yolk (bowl B)
- Melt butter and put to larger (glass) bowl C
- Bowl C: add powder sugar, add 1 teaspoon vanilla sugar, a pinch of salt, a pinch of cinnamon, mix well
- Slowly add egg yolk (bowl B) to bowl C while stirring
- Bowl A (glass): Beat egg white to snow and add sugar
- Manually mix 1/3 from bowl A into bowl C
- Bowl C: carefully lift the poppyseed and almond flour and the snow under the egg yolk mass until homogeneous looking
- Fill into the form
- Bake 50-70 minutes (you need to test it with a needle)
- After taking out let it rest for 5 minutes before turning
- Cover with powder sugar
