# Maultaschen (glutenfree)

Dinner for 4 persons. It can make sense to scale up the dough since you can
also freeze maultaschen for another day and the work is almost the same.


### Dough

- Mix 300 g flour, and 1 tsp salt
- Add 1 tbsp oil, 3-4 tbsp water
- Add 3-4 eggs
- Mix with hands (or some kitchen aid) until homogeneous and not too sticky
- Let rest


### Filling

- Fry bacon and 300 g minced meat
- Add 1 cut onion, chili, and garlic
- Cut up a slice of toast or dry bread and add
- Add mushrooms
- Add spinach

Move from pan to bowl, then:
- Add 1 egg
- Add parsley
- Season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg


### Create the pockets

- Divide dough into 4
- Roll each piece out
- Place portions of filling, fold over, close, and cut


### Cooking

- Cook pockets in salted water for 8-9 minutes
- Then "melt" them in a frying pan with butter and onions
